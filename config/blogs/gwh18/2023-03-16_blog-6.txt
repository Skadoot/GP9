Action 12: Code Walkthrough
A code walkthrough of the frontend and backend was held on Wednesday starting 3pm lasting 2 hours. We couldn't walkthrough
the JUnit tests yet as none have been uploaded to github.

Hours: 2

Action 14: Begin commenting front-end code

Some time was spent commenting code. Especially future methods that haven't been written yet. However, there's still significant
amounts of code that needs commenting because I focused on restructuring the design of the front-end instead.

After restructruing the front end, I've expanded the interface descriptions and made the addition of three sequence diagrams. I'm also
added sections for important algorithms and data structures.
