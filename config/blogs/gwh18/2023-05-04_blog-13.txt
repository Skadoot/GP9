Week: 10 Integration & Testing (2023/05/04)

Actions:

Action 1: Updating Log class

Log has a function that changes the current file it searches in from finished to unfinished or unfinished to finished games depending on the parameter passed.

Hours: 2

Actions 2: Bug fixes

Fixed promoted piece doesn't move after its promoted.
Promoting a pawn produces a duplicate FEN line in the logs that messes with logs. Promotions should occur in "one move" as soon as the pawn reaches the opposing players
camp. 
Fix blog that allows user to view past the number of moves made and before the board has even been constructed. Player should not be able to see a byeond the temporal timeline
of chess.
Fix bug where selecting a new tile that is not a valid tile not reseting the highlighted valid tiles on the chessboard. This is due to the backend not allowing null or opposing
player pieces being selected. Anyway, it's fixed and I want to drink.
Fixed player's being able to add names larger than the character limit.
Fixed bug caused by reckless function name change. Not naming names. My team's lovely.
Fixed a bug caused when current game ends by checkmate, resignation or agreement, and the player doesn't quit but decides to replay the chessboard. The log for the game
has moved to a new folder when the game ends but the log still searched in the old folder for the chessboard's history. Now it looks in the right folder.
