 ## The /active directory (IntelliJ Project)

 - OPEN ME AS AN INTELLIJ PROJECT! (or don't, I can't stop you.)
   - ```File -> Open -> /path_to_project/GP9/dev/active```
 - This directory contains the latest **unstable** version of the project.

 ## What do I do if I want to make changes/create a new file in active?

 Check the <a href="https://github.com/">GitLab issues</a> page to make sure no one else is developing using that file,

 then;
 
 <a href="https://gitlab.dcs.aber.ac.uk/group-9/GP9/-/issues/new">Create a new GitLab issue!</a>
 - Format the title as follows: Active Development - TestClass.java.
 - Assign the issue to **yourself**.
 - Add the "Active Development" label to the issue.
 - In the description, provide the full filepath from the dev/ directory (e.g. dev/active/src/main/java/uk.ac.aber.dcs/graphics/ExampleClass.java)
