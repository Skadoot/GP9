## The /src directory

- This directory contains the latest **stable and tested** version of the project.
- **DO NOT** actively work on files in this directory. (See <a href="/dev/README.md">dev/README.md</a> for details)
- Any changes that are made to this directory that are not approved beforehand will be reverted.
- This directory **DOES NOT** contain the most up-to-date project files.

## I want to submit something to source

- Is it a complete file?
- Are there any unfinished methods?
- Is it missing any functionality?
- Has it passed all of its tests in the test suite?
- If you're submitting a test class, don't worry about this.
- Does it conform to SE.QA.09 - Java Coding Standards?
- Does it have enough comments in the right places?
- Is it ready for review?

## Once you've asked yourself those questions, you can:

<a href="https://gitlab.dcs.aber.ac.uk/group-9/GP9/-/issues/new">Create a new GitLab issue!</a>

- Format the title as follows: Commit To Source - MyClass.java
- Assign the issue to me, TYW1
- Add the "Commit To Source" label to the issue. (This notifies me that it has been made)
- In the description, provide the full filepath from the dev/ directory (e.g.
  dev/active/src/main/java/uk.ac.aber.dcs/graphics/ExampleClass.java)

If the class/files are approved for submission, I will notify you by responding to the GitLab issue, and probably a DM
on Discord.
